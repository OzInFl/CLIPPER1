# Wave Sentinel - Public

Sub-Ghz - WiFi - Bluetooth 5 - Testing and Analysis Device

WT32-SC01-PLUS interface for the CC1101 module that allows standalone testing without the need for external devices.

UI Developed with Squareline Studio - All project files included so you can expand on the interface. 

However it can be expanded via BLE and/or WiFi as it contains the ESP32-S3 MCU.

The design is low cost and effective for RF testing and can be expanded by the customization of its firmware.

Looking forward to what the community has in store for this project!
