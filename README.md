Sub-Ghz - WiFi - Bluetooth 5 - Testing and Analysis Device

WT32-SC01-PLUS interface for the CC1101 module that allows standalone testing without the need for external devices.

However it can be expanded via BLE and/or WiFi as it contains the ESP32-S3 MCU.

The design is low cost and effective for RF testing and can be expanded by the customization of its firmware.

Looking forward to what the community has in store for this project!

Thanks to the creator of this fantastic CC1101 Library: https://github.com/LSatan/SmartRC-CC1101-Driver-Lib

Also : https://github.com/1technophile/NewRemoteSwitch.git for analysis functions..


Features Thus Far: 

Dual CC1101 Modules (Still being tested)
Ability to Play FlipperZero .sub files from the SD card. 
Sub-Ghz Protocol analyzer (thanks to the SmartRC Library) - Still needs some love but is working. 
Wifi Scanner - For 2.4Ghz Wifi - will populate the found hotspots in the Dropdown for whatever...
Tesla Charge Port Tester - Dedicated button - Thanks to (https://github.com/fredilarsen/TeslaChargeDoorOpener) for the actual protocol rather than a capture.
